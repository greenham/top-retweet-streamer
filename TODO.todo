 ☐ Keep a state of what keywords are currently being tracked and update the twitter stream as necessary
   - The twitter stream should be independent of the client socket connection
   - This will allow multiple keywords to be tracked at once
   - The client only needs to worry about being fed data from the tailable mongo cursor
 ☐ Create new UI using React
 ☐ Update to latest bootstrap
 ☐ When receiving a search request, do initial poll+populate on the database instead of twitter
 ☐ Support multiple feeds of queries
 ☐ Support changing amount of tweets shown on client-side (dropdown with 10, 20, 50)
